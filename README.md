## Introduction 

CityQuiz3 is a tool to certificate user's knowledge. By playing a 2D RPG Open World game in the metaverse, the user can access to a diferent places and talk with other NPCs. Users can evolve their knowledge and receive NFTs when passes the quizzes. 

For the MVP, we have implemented a simple mechanic where the user can login or register and complete two quizzes from the Polkadot Ecosystem. When the use complete the quiz, he can mint a personalized NFT like:

## Vision

Our mission is to develop the knowledge protocol. By receiving NFTs as certificate, users can demonstrate their mastery to other entities unlocking new features, services or products. We pretend to make eaiser the knowledge validation.


## Characteristics 

We propose the creation of a video game, under the "Play To Earn" modality, "Learn To Earn", focused on encouraging its users to research, educate and discover the tools and projects that exist within a Blockchain, where by meeting objectives you will be able to unlock rewards in NFT related to the Blockchain in question.
A city in squares, where your character is identified by a wallet, where you can move around the different circuits of the city and find a key piece to complete your collection
